Hey! I'm Vinay Sharma, a tech enthusiast and first-year student at IIITDM Kancheepuram, currently exploring the fascinating world of Autonomous Systems and Robotics. I have a deep interest in coding, embedded systems, and intelligent automation, and this AUV project is a step toward combining all of that into real-world innovation.
