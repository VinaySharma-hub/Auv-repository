I tried really hard, but those was tough. I'm still learning Python, and ROS is a whole other task , but I kept mixing things up. My code almost worked, but I ran out of many errors. But between learning Python and ROS at the same time, I just couldn’t connect the things fast enough. The clock beat me.
There’s too much to learn at once.
